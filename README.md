# XCS-IMG
XCS-IMG is the adaptation of accuracy based learning classifier system (XCS) for images. It is a step towards explainable artificial intelligence (XAI).We have demonstrated how the evolved rules can be visualized to explain the
classification result. The system uses concept of filters that are evolved during the learning phase to capture image features that can be visualized.
