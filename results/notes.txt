initial fitness .01
fintess reduction .1
check action  set subsumption
prediction error reduction is 1 instead of .25 as in the paper

still open question:
why the fitness of classifiers with zero TP can be highest?
wrong action: reward 0 , prediction 0 , accuracy high, fitness high?

Investigation required:
Why the accuracy is either 1 or less than .09?

todo:
- implement result reuse for filters
- remove all subsumption after implementing the filter list. check all subsumption how it is working
- what if the new filter subsumes another filter in the filter list? Probably we don't need it as it is a new filter. Also should we consider other attributes of subsumers as per the xcs algorithm before subsumption?
- implement don't care/ masking for filters (should get generic filters)
- implement different types of filters
