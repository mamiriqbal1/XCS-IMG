initial fitness .01
fintess reduction .1
check action  set subsumption

prediction error reduction is 1 instead of .25 as in the paper


still open question:
why the fitness of classifiers with zero TP can be highest?
wrong action: reward 0 , prediction 0 , accuracy high, fitness high?

Investigation required:
Why the accuracy is either 1 or less than .09?

todo:
potential infinite loop in mutation and crossover to be handled
mutation probability is being used at allele level, it should be at higher level?
