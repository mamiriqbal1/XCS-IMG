initial fitness .01
fintess reduction .1
check action  set subsumption
prediction error reduction is 1 instead of .25 as in the paper

still open question:
why the fitness of classifiers with zero TP can be highest?
wrong action: reward 0 , prediction 0 , accuracy high, fitness high?

Investigation required:
Why the accuracy is either 1 or less than .09?

todo:
- implement don't care/ masking for filters (should get generic filters)
- implement different types of filters (different sizes, with don't care values, dilated filters)
- why tournament selection is using fitness/numerosity? Try to understand the function
- implement GP crossover
- think about filter composition / layering
- implement crossover at three levels (classifier, code fragment, filter) and mutation at 2 levels (code fragment and filter)
- in mutation what if action is mutated, in that case the evaluation of the mutated filter is not required to be true (or same as previous filter).
- consider implementing a pre-processing step for extracting features from all the classes.



filter types:
1. different sizes
No filter crossover
mutation ok
subsumption: only subsume if same size. 

2. dilated filters
same as different sizes



now is more general CF and filter functions are not being used because filter subsumption has been moved to filter observed list. Does it have any impact on the algorithm


The match set, action set have separate allocations. Kill set is wired. Clean up the code and verify the results to be sure

code cleanup in progress. changes done, compilation successful
action set updates are not being reflected in the population
