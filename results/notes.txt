initial fitness .01
fintess reduction .1
check action  set subsumption

prediction error reduction is 1 instead of .25 as in the paper


still open question:
why the fitness of classifiers with zero TP can be highest?
wrong action: reward 0 , prediction 0 , accuracy high, fitness high?


/*
 * Code review notes:
 * Instead of using epsilon-greedy strategy for exploration and exploitation, the code is doing
 * only exploration. However it always performs a second pass for monitoring the performance.
 * It should be changed to use epsilon-greedy strategy and also the performance monitoring part should be
 * modified to calculate training and validation accuracies after every epoch.
