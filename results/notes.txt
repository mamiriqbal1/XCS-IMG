initial fitness .01
fintess reduction .1
check action  set subsumption
prediction error reduction is 1 instead of .25 as in the paper

still open question:
why the fitness of classifiers with zero TP can be highest?
wrong action: reward 0 , prediction 0 , accuracy high, fitness high?

Investigation required:
Why the accuracy is either 1 or less than .09?

todo:
- implement reusing filters from observed list (for the moment there are negligible "promising classifiers". 
- implement don't care/ masking for filters (should get generic filters)
- implement different types of filters
- why tournament selection is using fitness/numerosity?
- implement evaluation cache for testing/validation iteration
