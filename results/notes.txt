initial fitness .01
fintess reduction .1
check action  set subsumption

prediction error reduction is 1 instead of .25 as in the paper


still open question:
why the fitness of classifiers with zero TP can be highest?
wrong action: reward 0 , prediction 0 , accuracy high, fitness high?


Todo: Revisit mutation and do + or - in every iteration
